			<supplinf>Medicine Creek  Treaty:
Beginning at Three Tree Point ('Pulley Point') the boundary follows Watershed Administrative Unit (WAU) lines to the summit of Mt.Rainier, then south and west following Water Resource Inventory Area (WRIA) 11 and 13 to the ridge above the Skookumchuck River. This best describes the 'divide between the waters of the Puyallup and Dwamish, or White Rivers to the summit of the Cascade Mountains (Mt. Rainier)' and the 'thence southerly, along the summit of said range to a point opposite the main source of the Skookum Chuck Creek'. The portion; 'thence to and down said creek, to the coal mine' follows the Skookumchuck to a point opposite the Centralia Coal Mine site and 'thence northwesterly, to the summit of the Black Hills' follows a constructed line northwesterly toward Mima area to the intersection of a WAU boundary  to Capitol Peak, and to Larch and Rock Candy Mountain summits; 'thence northerly, to the upper forks of the Satsop River' follows  WRIA14/23 boundary and WRIA14/22 boundary. Using the WRIA14/16 boundary and a ridgeline dividing Hood Canal's Great Bend/Lynch Cove area and south running drainages to Mason Lake and WRIA14 for , 'thence northeasterly through the portage known as Wilkes's Portage'. It's presumed the Wilkes Expedition used a portage between Case Inlet and Hood Canal or between Sinclair Inlet and Lynch Cove (Hood Canal). WAU boundaries were used continuing from the WRIA14/15 line to a ridge opposite Long Lake then south and east following a ridge or high ground to 'Point Southworth' and 'thence around the foot (based on coordinate directions in the treaty this was assumed to be the northern tip) of Vashon's Island, easterly and southeasterly, to the place of beginning'.

Point No Point Treaty:
Here all is fairly straight forward through the Olympic Peninsula (even though it's described as the 'summit of the Cascade Range') and to the 'west branch of the Satsop River, down that branch to the main fork'; 'thence eastwardly ( follow the East Fork Satsop River to the closest easterly ridge line [WAU] and follow that to the summit ridge [WRIA] ) and following the line of lands heretofore ceded to the the United States by the Nisqually and other tribes and bands of Indians, to the summit of the Black Hills is represented here as a line between the junction of the Satsop and it's forks and Capitol Peak in the Black Hills, and northeastwardly (following WRIA boundary to WAU intersection above Great Bend on Hood Canal, then along WAU divide between Hood Canal and the remainder of WRIA 14) to the portage known as Wilkes' Portage (The Wilkes Portage referred to in the Medicine, Point No Point and Point Elliot treaties is either between Case Inlet and Lynch Cover or between Sinclair Inlet and Lynch Cove, on Hood Canal. Since neither is specified a line was chosen continuing along the ridge line [WAU] paralleling the Union River) ; thence northeastwardly, and following the line of lands heretofore ceded to the United States by the Dwamish, Suquamish, and other tribes and bands of Indians, (WAU boundary divide through the Kitsap peninsula) 'to Suquamish Head; thence northerly through Admiralty Inlet to the Straits of Fuca; thence westwardly through said straits to the place of beginning'.

Camp Stevens, Walla Walla and Yakama Treaties:
The main area of contention here lies in Benton County from the Columbia at 'the lower end of a large island below the mouth of Umatilla River, thence northerly to a point on the Yakama River, called Tomah-luke, thence to Le Lac, thence to the White Banks on the Columbia below Priest's Rapids'. The 'large island', now mostly covered by water from the John Day Dam, is the island group south west of Paterson, Washington. The overland boundary has been drawn using drainages following a northeasterly direction to the Yakima River, crossing at Cold Creek (assuming this to be 'Toma-luke')  then up Cold Creek and overland northerly along the base of a plateau to where intermittent ponds or wetlands shows on the quad maps (maybe the site of 'Le Lac'), around the north end of Gable Mountain and down a drainage to the White Bluffs in the area of East White Bluffs.</supplinf>
			<langdata Sync="TRUE">en</langdata><abstract>This dataset describes Native American Ceded Tribal lands in Washington State. Boundary lines have been digitized from a variety of digital data sources including 1:100,000 streams for boundaries described in treaties as following a stream or river, 1:24k Water Resource Inventory Areas (WRIA), Watershed Administrative Unit (WAU) and Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) boundaries for boundaries referred to in treaties as 'divide', 'summit' or 'between the waters of', 1:100,000 Major Public Lands (for current reservation areas), 10 meter DEM and 7.5 minute USGS digital Quad maps (to define ridgelines and 'divide' where WRIA, WAU or HUC boundaries don't exist) and NAIP orthophoto imagery (to get a feel for what a questionable boundary area actually looks like today). Ceded Land treaty areas are based on treaty language and US Government decrees dated 1854-1892. Natural geographic barriers such as streams and ridge lines were used where described or eluded to in treaty descriptions. Coordinate based latitude/longitude boundary lines were used in some Central Washington areas where described. References to general compass directions were followed using natural barriers such as watershed boundaries or drainages wherever possible. Some treaty boundary descriptions were found to be inadequate, inaccurate and in some cases misleading in nature in describing what should have been a natural boundary or even a coordinate based solution to a property description. Some of these boundary areas open to interpretation are discussed below in the Supplemental Information based on the language and definite boundaries of other treaty areas. Ceded areas in Oregon and Idaho from the Camp Stevens Treaties have been included in this data
with the state boundary dividing them.

thence, in a southwesterly direction, to the Columbia River (following the most direct drainages through this route), at the western extremity of the "Big Island" (this refers to the now mostly submerged Blalock Island), between the mouths of the Umatilla River and Butler Creek ('Butler Creek' is assumed to be the current Alder Creek); all which latter boundaries separate the above confederated tribes and bands from the Walla-Walla, Cayuse, and Umatilla tribes and bands of Indians; thence down the Columbia River to midway between the mouths Of White Salmon and Wind Rivers; thence along the divide between said rivers to the main ridge of the Cascade Mountains; and thence along said ridge to the place of beginning.</edomvds></edom><edom><edomv>Treaty of Neah Bay</edomv><edomvd>signed 1855</edomvd><edomvds>Commencing at the mouth of the Oke-ho River (Hoko River), on the Straits of Fuca;  thence running westwardly with said straits to Cape Classett or Flattery;  thence southwardly along the coast to Osett, or the Lower Cape Flattery;  thence eastwardly  along the line of lands occupied by the Kwe-deh-tut or Kwill-eh-yute tribe of Indians (up the Ozette River, along the northern shore of Lake Ozette to the Big River, up the Big River to a point closest the Olympic crest WRIA20 boundary), to the summit of the coast-range of mountains , and thence northwardly along the line of lands lately ceded to the United States by the S'Klallam tribe (then along Olympic crest to the divide [WAU] between the South Fork of the Sekiu River and Hoko River and following the divide ridge) to the place of beginning , including all the islands lying off the same on the straits and coast.
